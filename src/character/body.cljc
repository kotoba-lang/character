(defn- ring-mesh
  "Shared ring/cylinder mesh builder used by both body and clothing:
  `radius-fn` takes `t` (ring progress 0..1) and returns `[rx rz]`.

  Normals (/loop maturity pass, visual-quality follow-up): the previous
  version used a purely circumferential normal (`[cos theta, 0, sin theta]`)
  for every ring regardless of how the profile actually tapers — correct
  for a straight cylinder, but wrong (never tilts) wherever `radius-fn`/
  `y-fn` actually narrows or widens (every real body part here). This
  computes a real surface-of-revolution normal via `cross(tangent_theta,
  tangent_t)`, where `tangent_t` is a central-difference estimate of how
  `[rx rz y]` changes along `t` (numeric, since `radius-fn`/`y-fn` are
  opaque closures with no analytic derivative available) — so the normal
  correctly leans across a taper instead of staying perfectly radial. This
  does not by itself fix visible faceting (that's segment/ring COUNT,
  addressed at each call site below); it fixes normals being subtly WRONG
  on every tapered surface, which independently softens/corrects shading."
