  "Regression coverage for a real bug found integrating `character` into
  `kotoba-lang/kami-app-character-creator` (ADR-2607031200 Phase 2): four call
  sites (`blendshape.cljc` x3, `metahuman.cljc` x1) used bare `Math/signum`,
  which compiles under ClojureScript to a literal, nonexistent `Math.signum`
  JS call (browsers only have `Math.sign`) — `TypeError: Math.signum is not a
  function` at runtime, on the very first `character/generate-character` call
  in a browser. This JVM test can't reproduce the cljs failure directly (that
  needs an actual cljs runtime), but it pins `character.math/signum`'s
  intended semantics so the fix doesn't silently regress."
